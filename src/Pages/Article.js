      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold my-4">The Evolution of Mobile Payment Systems</h2>
      <h3 class="text-base text-start font-semibold my-4">Early Innovations:</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">The journey of mobile payment systems began in the early 2000s with text message-based payments and mobile banking services. Companies like PayPal (1998) and M-Pesa (2007) pioneered digital payments, allowing users to send and receive money via SMS or web interfaces. These early systems laid the foundation for more sophisticated mobile payment technologies.</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-base text-start font-semibold my-4">Rise of Smartphones:</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">The proliferation of smartphones in the late 2000s catalyzed the development of mobile payment applications. Apple Pay (2014), Google Wallet (2011, now Google Pay), and Samsung Pay (2015) introduced near-field communication (NFC) technology for contactless payments, enabling users to tap their phones at point-of-sale (POS) terminals to complete transactions. These innovations brought mobile payments into the mainstream, offering a convenient alternative to traditional payment methods.</p>
  
      <h3 class="text-base text-start font-semibold my-4">Expansion of Digital Wallets:</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">Digital wallets, such as Venmo (2009) and Alipay (2004), gained popularity by providing platforms for storing payment information, making online purchases, and transferring money between users. These wallets integrated multiple payment methods, loyalty programs, and additional features, enhancing the versatility and user experience of mobile payments.</p>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold my-4">Digital Wallets: </h2>
  
      <p class="mb-6">Digital wallets store payment information and allow users to make purchases online or in-store. Prominent examples are:</p>
      <p class="mb-6">PayPal: A widely used platform for online transactions, offering payment solutions for individuals and businesses.
